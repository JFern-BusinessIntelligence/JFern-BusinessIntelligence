Hi, I’m @JFern-BusinessIntelligence. I specialize in the world of BI. 
This includes working with data in the following ways: Collection, Storage, Transformation, Enrichment, Analytics, Visualization, and Insights.

I am heavily invested in the logistics industry. I have BS in Business Supply Chain, and will be finishing my Masters in Operations Management this spring.

I love to collaborate on the most efficient ways to surface real time and powerful insights to business partners. 
The proprietary software and applications available makes this process incredibly fun and enlightening.

I can be reached at jordan.fernandezprof@gmail.com.
